# What is *Pd*?

***Pseudogymnoascus destructans*** (*P. desctructans* or *Pd*) is a [psychrophilic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/psychrophilic) fungus that is the causative agent for the disease white-nose syndrome (WNS), which is one of the most significant threats to many North American bat species. This fungus grows optimally between 12-15 degrees C and in areas of high humidity (over 85%), which happen to be characteristics similar to many North American bat [hibernacula](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hibernaculum). In hibernation, as bats enter [torpor](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/torpor), their body temperatures lower to match the ambient -- and fungus-supporting -- temperature of the hibernacula. When the fungus grows on the bat bodies, typically on wings and around their faces, it increases water loss from the bats' bodies. Dehydrated, fungus-impacted bats arouse from torpor more frequently throughout hibernation to replenish water. However, increased arousals from torpor throughout the season cause bats to burn through their fat reserves too quickly. With no food outside to replenish these, WNS-impacted bats starve and rarely survive winter.

For this assignment, I used a data set from the Haase lab that includes data collected from 44 bats, specifically:

-   Bat age in years,

-   bat mass in grams, and

-   presence (1) or absence (2) of *Pd* on bat body

I was interested in looking at how bat age and mass may impact the probability that the fungus will be found on a bat. To do model and visualize this, I used a GLM with a [binomial family](https://www.statmethods.net/advstats/glm.html) and a logit link function, which is the default function for binomial data. As we discussed in class, the logit is the natural logarithm of the odds of occurrence; the odds are defined as the ratio of successes to failures.

# Pd and Bat Age

```{r Pd and Bat Age - Plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

# Plot binary data - Presence of P. destructans on bat as a function of bat age in years
  ggplot(bats, aes(age.years, pd)) +
    geom_point(size=3) +
    geom_smooth(method="glm", method.args=list(family="binomial"(link="logit")), color = "cyan") +
    labs(title="Bat Age and Fungal Presence") +
    ylab ("Probability of Fungus Presence") +
    xlab ("Bat Age (Years)") +
    theme_light()

```

```{r Pd and Bat Age - Model, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

# Model this relationship: 
  model_bats_age <- glm(pd ~ age.years, data=bats, family=binomial)
  model_bats_age  
  coef(model_bats_age)
  confint(model_bats_age)
  summary(model_bats_age)

```

## Interpretations

<font size="4">**Slope**:</font> Dividing the slope coefficient by four will give us an approximate estimate for the maximum predicted effect on the response of a unit change in the predictor. Slope of the 'age' predictor variable was **0.13**. In this case, a difference in 1 unit of bat age (years) corresponds to a increase in the probability of fungus presence of 3.2%, since 0.13/4 = 0.032.

<font size="4">**AIC**:</font> For the scope of this assignment, I will compare this model's AIC value of **61.108** to the AIC value of the next model, which uses bat mass as a predictor variable.

<font size="4">**P-value**:</font> The p-value for the 'age' predictor variable is **0.0701**, which is not less than 0.05. So, we can say that age is *not* a statistically significant predictor variable in this model.

<font size="4">**Residual deviance**:</font> How well can the response variable be predicted by the specific model? The lower the value, the better the model is able to predict the value of the response variable. Here, the residual deviance was **57.108 on 42 degrees of freedom**. To fully interpret this, we will have to compute the Chi-Square statistic... (Null deviance - Residual deviance) with *P* degrees of freedom. Ours is about 3, with 1 dof. This generates a p-value of about 0.083265 (via [statology](https://www.statology.org/interpret-glm-output-in-r/), which still is not significant. Age may not be the best predictor of *Pd* presence.

<font size="4">**Coefficient estimate**:</font> average change in the odds of the response variable associated with a one unit increase in each predictor variable... Here, a one unit increase in the 'age' predictor variable is associated with an average change of **0.13416** in the log odds of the response variable '*Pd* presence' being a 1. Lower values of age appear to be associated with a lower likelihood of *Pd* being present.

# Pd and Bat Mass

```{r Pd and Bat Mass - Plot, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

# Plot binary data - Presence of P. destructans on bat as a function of bat mass in grams
  ggplot(bats, aes(mass.grams, pd)) +
    geom_point(size=3) +
    geom_smooth(method="glm", method.args=list(family="binomial"(link="logit")), color = "cyan") +
    labs(title="Bat Mass and Fungal Presence") +
    ylab ("Probability of Fungus Presence") +
    xlab ("Bat Mass (g)") +
    theme_light()
  
```

```{r Pd and Bat Mass - Model, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)

# Model this relationship:

model_bats_mass <- glm(pd ~ mass.grams, data=bats, family=binomial) 
model_bats_mass
coef(model_bats_mass) 
confint(model_bats_mass) 
summary(model_bats_mass)

```

## Interpretations

<font size="4">**Slope**:</font> Dividing the slope coefficient by four will give us an approximate estimate for the maximum predicted effect on the response of a unit change in the predictor. Slope of the 'mass' predictor variable was **0.463**. In this case, a difference in 1 unit of bat mass (g) corresponds to a increase in the probability of fungus presence of 12%, since 0.463/4 = 0.12.

<font size="4">**AIC**:</font> For the scope of this assignment, I will compare this model's AIC value of **60.181** to the AIC value of the previous model, which was very close at 61.108. This model is *slightly* better, but still not great. 

<font size="4">**P-value**:</font> The p-value for the 'mass' predictor variable is **0.0463**, which *is* less than 0.05. So, we can say that mass is a statistically significant predictor variable in this model.

<font size="4">**Residual deviance**:</font> How well can the response variable be predicted by the specific model? The lower the value, the better the model is able to predict the value of the response variable. Here, the residual deviance was **56.181 on 42 degrees of freedom**. To fully interpret this, we will have to compute the Chi-Square statistic... (Null deviance - Residual deviance) with *P* degrees of freedom. Ours is about 4.5, with 1 dof. This generates a p-value of about 0.033895 (via [statology](https://www.statology.org/interpret-glm-output-in-r/), which is still significant.

<font size="4">**Coefficient estimate**:</font> average change in the odds of the response variable associated with a one unit increase in each predictor variable... Here, a one unit increase in the 'mass' predictor variable is associated with an average change of **0.4629529** in the log odds of the response variable '*Pd* presence' being a 1. Lower values of mass appear to be associated with a lower likelihood of *Pd* being present.
